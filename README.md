# Farhat_Football

Moving away from using a spreadshoot for our football sessions and towards a relational database online

So a database for the players stats, a database for the matches

Page for rules

Page for upcoming game and shows the list of players who are down

Page to direct you to matches, sorted by month

Front end you can click on a match and it will give you the stats for that match as well as the YouTube link

Page for each player, attributes, stats and most importantly, how much they owe,

Search function only

I have to make it so only I can do input, how to input and alter data, SQL/MongoDB

Have to compile it in such a way that I can feed player data to an ai to balance teams

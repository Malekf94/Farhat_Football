# Farhat_Football

Moving away from using a spreadshoot for our football sessions and towards a relational database online
So a database for the players, a database for the matches

Page for rules

Page for upcoming game and shows the list of players who are down

Page to direct you to matches, can be filtered by date

Front end you can click on a match and it will give you the stats for that match as well as the YouTube link

Everyone gets view and Search function only, admins(e.g.myself) have ability to input data

I have to make it so only I can do input, how to input and alter data, SQL/MongoDB

Have to compile it in such a way that I can feed player data to an ai to balance teams

Attributes are as follows

Dribbling Finishing First Touch Long shots Movement

Short Passing Long passing Vision

Tackling Positioning Marking

Concentration Decision Making Leadership Consistency Aggression

Stamina Workrate Pace Strength

Player database will also include stats for goals, assists and MoTM that can be filtered by date, also contains how much they owe

There should be a page, where I input how much someone has paid and it would enter that into their account, a player can have balance in the -, which means I owe him money

Match database will have the date, day. list of players, whether they came late, what team they are on, and goals/assists per player

The two database will be joined by player ID

There should also be a database to combine all matches.

Future thoughts:- how to make it so if someone is organising their own games, they can create an account and it will set up this for them
